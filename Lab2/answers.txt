2.1 Minimization of functions of one variable

2 - Observing Table 1, one can see that the relationship between a and eta is a = 1/eta.
This can be proven by knowing that, with f = a*x^2/2, one has grad(f) = a*x.

From the iterative equation and knowing that the minimum value for this class of functions happens at x = 0, the equation to solve is:

x_(n+1) = x_n - eta*a*x_n <=> 0 = x_n - eta*a*x_n <=> (with x_n != 0) eta*a = 1 <=> a = 1/eta, QED.

3 - Again, by observing the values in Table 1, it is possible to state that the relation is a = 2/eta.
This is proven by knowing that the algorithm diverges when the step size (|x_(n+1) - x_n|) is double the separation between x_n and the x corresponding to the function minimum (in this case x = 0).
So, the threshold is defined when this limit starts:

|x_(n+1) - x_n| = 2*x_n <=> |-eta*a*x_n| = 2*x_n <=> (with x_n != 0) a = 2/eta, QED

4 - Other than the fastest conversion and divergence threshold values, it is visible that the step size eta is highly influential in the convergence of the method.
An increase in the 2nd derivative of the function, naturally, makes it narrower and, thus, the method diverges for smaller step sizes.
Moreover, it will converge faster for the smallest step size (eta = 0.001).
